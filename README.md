# Draughts
This is a C++ program designed specifically for playing draughts. It has been developed using Visual Studio and implements the minimax algorithm to determine the optimal move. Instead of clicking, the program allows players to control their pieces by hovering over them and pressing the space bar. You can find the .exe in ./x64/debug, with the name test.exe.
